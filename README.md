# TopDownTemplate
A modification on the Top Down Template provided by Crytek with CryEngine. 
It has all of the network code removed and has the GamePlugin not be tightly coupled with our player class.
The bullet has a timer on it after it collides with an object and will be removed when that timer reaches zero.
